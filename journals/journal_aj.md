#### Retrospective

In what ways have your thoughts about the design changed this week and why?
> I have realised why more and more people design desktop app as web apps. Because its a lot easier to prototype a nice gui compared to relying on a typically desktop gui which doesn't give you much control, and makes me partially regret trying to spend a significant amount of time implementing a WX gui.

Did you discuss these ideas with the group? What was the outcome?
> Yes, but we were all ready too far in so not much could be done except for soldiering on.

How did you validate your progress this week?
> I've been accepting pull requests and fixing issues, so I guess that's a good sign.
