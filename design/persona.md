# Persona: Steve

## Background
Steve is a blind programming student at North Metropolitan TAFE. He has a background web 
development and has an understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Without the use of 
accessibility software, Steve feels left behind or excluded by typical media and content, as 
said content usually isn't considerate of their consumer's sightedness. To interact with and 
navigate his computer, Steve utilises a screen reader, NVDA.  

## Goals
Steve uses the app to consume video based programming tutorials, it empowers him to access 
the same resources as everyone else, being able to review video tutorials outside class. 

## Needs
- Steve needs to know when code visually appears in the video and be empowered to interact 
  with it.
- Steve mainly interacts with his computer through the keyboard, utilising hotkeys to 
  navigate between applications and their elements, it benefits Steve when the text 
  descriptions for these elements are concise.
